      "abstract": "Certification is important to guarantee the correct functioning of quantum devices. A key certification task is verifying that a device has produced a desired output state. In this work, we study this task in the context of photonic platforms, where single photons are propagated through linear optical interferometers to create large, entangled resource states for metrology, communication, quantum advantage demonstrations and for so-called linear optical quantum computing (LOQC). This setting derives its computational power from the indistinguishability of the photons, i.e., their relative overlap. Therefore, standard fidelity witnesses developed for distinguishable particles (including qubits) do not apply directly, because they merely certify the closeness to some fixed target state. We introduce a measure of fidelity suitable for this setting and show several different ways to witness it, based on earlier proposals for measuring genuine multi-photon indistinguishability. We argue that a witness based upon the discrete Fourier transform is an optimal choice. We experimentally implement this witness and certify the fidelity of several multi-photon states.",

For this we use a specific state preparation and measurement of the superposed source mass, including a postselection, which altogether results in a repulsive gravitational force on the probe particle. A classical gravitational field can never lead to repulsion, as the effect requires quantum interference of two distinct states of gravity. We also present a calculation in the Heisenberg picture under the formalism of weak values that illustrates how repulsion is achieved. Finally, we estimate the range of parameters (masses and the spatio-temporal extent of interference) for which the experiment is feasible.",

By employing double cover of the rotation group, we extend the Hilbert series to the non-relativistic systems, and eliminates redundancies introduced by the spin operator. We also generalize the Young tensor method to the non-relativistic cases through the $SU(2)$ semi-standard Young tableaux, which allows for the construction of operator bases with repeated fields at any given mass dimension. Utilizing the Young tensor technique and Hibert series as cross-check, we obtain the complete operator bases for the following cases: heavy particle (and also heavy quark) effective theory operators up to mass dimension 9; pion-less effective theory operators, including nucleon-nucleon contact interactions up to $\\mathcal{O}(Q^4)$ and three-nucleon interactions at $\\mathcal{O}(Q^2)$; and finally the spin-1/2 dark matter-nucleon operators up to $\\mathcal{O}(v^4)$.",

      "abstract": "The standard approach to quantum measurement discrimination is to perform the given unknown measurement on a probe state, possibly entangled with an auxiliary system, and make a decision based on the measurement outcome obtained. In this work, we go beyond the standard aforementioned scenarios by consider not only the classical measurement outcome of a measurement, but also its the post-measurement quantum state. More specifically, instead of considering only the positive-operator valued measure (POVM) operators, we consider their associated Lüders' instrument associated with them. We prove that, when the post-measurement quantum states are available, the task of discriminating two qubit projective measurements is equivalent to discriminating two copies of quantum states associated to each projector pair, extending previous results known for the case where probe states are separable. Then, we proceed by showing that the advantage of considering post-measurement states in measurement discrimination can be large. We formalise this claim by presenting a family of pairs of measurements where the ratio between the discrimination bias of the measurement discrimination task with and without post-measurement states can be arbitrarily large. This shows that, while the post-measurement state was neglected in most of the previous literature, its use can significantly improve the performance of quantum measurement discrimination.",

      "abstract": "Primordial non-Gaussianity generated by additional fields during inflation offers a compelling observational target. Heavy fields imprint characteristic oscillatory signals in non-Gaussian correlation functions of the inflaton, a process sometimes referred to as cosmological-collider physics. These distinct signatures are compelling windows into ultra-high-energy physics, but are often suppressed, making standard equilateral non-Gaussianity the most promising discovery channel in many scenarios. In this paper, we show that direct couplings between the inflaton and additional fields can lead to a wide variety of novel, observationally relevant signals which open new parameter regimes that simultaneously exhibit the characteristics of light and heavy fields. We identify these primordial signatures in the late-time observables of the large-scale structure of the Universe, where they most significantly modify the scale-dependent bias of the galaxy power spectrum to include an oscillatory modulation around a non-trivial power law. We explore the full range of parameters that phenomenologically arise in these models and study the sensitivity of current and future galaxy surveys, finding that this new class of primordial non-Gaussianity is particularly accessible in near-term surveys due to its oscillatory feature. Finally, we perform an analysis of existing data from the final release of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS DR12). While we find no evidence for a signal, we demonstrate significant improvements in sensitivity over respective non-oscillatory scenarios and place the first constraints on this extended parameter space of oscillatory non-Gaussianity.",

In particular, we identify two qualitatively different approaches to gauging qLDPC codes to obtain their non-Abelian counterparts. The first approach applies to codes that exhibit a generalized form of Poincaré duality and leads to a qLDPC non-Abelian Clifford stabilizer code, whose stabilizers are reminiscent of the action of a Type-III twisted quantum double. Our second approach applies to general qLDPC codes, and uses a graph of ancilla qubits which may be tailored to properties of the input codes to gauge a single transversal gate. For both constructions, the resulting gauged codes are shown to have properties analogous to 2D non-Abelian topological order -- e.g. the analog of a single anyon on a torus. We conclude by demonstrating that our gauging procedures enable magic state preparation via the measurement of logical Clifford gates. Consequently, our gauging constructions offer a protocol for performing non-Clifford operations on any qLDPC code.",

Such sensors can be spatially separated (gradiometry or gravitational-wave detection) or consist of different internal states (magnetometry or quantum clock interferometry), in which case a signal-amplitude modulation may serve as a signature of a differential phase. In this work, we introduce Phase Estimation from Amplitude Collapse (PEAC) by applying targeted fitting methods for different magnetically sensitive substates of an atom interferometer. We demonstrate that PEAC provides higher trueness (up to 80% bias reduction) than standard tools for perfectly correlated signals. At its working point near, but not exactly at phase settings resulting in vanishing amplitude, it achieves precision competitive with standard methods, contrasting prior claims of optimal operation at vanishing amplitude. PEAC presents a generally applicable complementary evaluation method for correlated interferometers without phase stability, increasing the overall accuracy and enabling applications beyond atom interferometry.",

We develop a thermodynamic framework in which energy fluctuations can retain genuinely quantum-coherent contributions. We foliate state space into \"minimum-variance leaves,\" defined by minimizing the average energy variance over all pure-state decompositions, with the minimum set by the quantum Fisher information. On each leaf we construct the least-biased state compatible with normalization and mean energy, defining a leaf-canonical ensemble. The Gibbs ensemble is recovered on the distinguished commuting leaf, while generic states are organized by their leaf label. This structure provides a natural setting to extend eigenstate thermalization beyond equilibrium via a \"leaf typicality\" hypothesis. According to that hypothesis, under unitary time evolution local observables depend only on the leaf and energy and, at all times, are reproduced by evolving a representative (pure) state drawn from the optimal ensemble.",

These phenomena may serve as favorable observational criteria for identifying regular stars in future searches.",

      "abstract": "Analytical and algebraic geometry are valuable tools for dealing with problems involving analytical functions and polynomials. In what we connote as spatial quantum sensing the goal is, given an underlying field and a set of quantum sensors interrogating the field in a set of positions, to find an estimator for some property the field. This property can have multiple forms, be it distinguishing the source of a target signal, or evaluating the field (or a derivative thereof) in an arbitrary position. In this work we also link this problem to networks of quantum sensors, and the role and usefulness of entangling these sensors. We find that the estimators that come out as a solution to the problem are such that a non-local entangled strategy provides maximum precision. We start by working under the assumption of polynomial fields, which relates to the interpolation problem, and then generalize for any signal that is modeled via analytical functions, giving rise to any general least-squares estimator. We discuss the effects of the placement of the sensors in the estimation, namely, how to find well defined, construction error-free placements for the sensors. In the case of interpolation we provide concrete examples and proofs in a $m$-dimensional array of sensors, and discuss necessary and sufficient conditions for the more general cases. We provide clear examples of the possible use-cases and statements, and compare a non-local entangled strategy with the best local strategy for an interpolation problem, showing the benefit in terms of precision in a distributed sensing scenario. This is a key tool for a wide-range of problem in sensing problems, ranging from large-scale such as earth-sized experiments, to local-scale, such has biological experiments.",

This theory describes large-scale ballistic fluctuations of conserved charges and associated currents and, by exploiting the height-field formulation of twist fields, gives access to the asymptotic behaviour of their two-point correlation functions. In Del Vecchio Del Vecchio et al. $[1]$, this approach was applied to the special case of branch-point twist fields used to compute entanglement entropies within the replica approach. Here, we extend those results by applying BFT to composite branch-point twist fields, obtained by inserting an additional gauge field. Focusing on free fermions, we derive analytic expressions for charged Rényi entropies both at equilibrium, in generalized Gibbs ensembles, and out of equilibrium following a quantum quench from $U(1)$ preserving pair producing integrable initial states.

This stability requires no ad hoc symmetry and renders Kaluza-Klein dark matter a well-motivated candidate, provided it reproduces the observed relic abundance. The minimal UED (mUED) framework being highly predictive is strongly constrained by the combined requirements of relic density and collider searches under standard cosmological assumptions. We revisit the dark matter phenomenology of mUED in the presence of a nonstandard cosmological history featuring a low reheating temperature driven by prolonged inflaton decay. Solving the coupled Boltzmann equations for dark matter, radiation, and inflaton energy densities, we show that entropy injection during reheating can dilute the relic abundance by orders of magnitude, reopening large regions of parameter space previously ruled out. We further demonstrate that the revived parameter space is consistent with current collider, direct-detection, and indirect-detection constraints, while remaining testable by upcoming experiments.",

      "abstract": "Scalable quantum computers and quantum networks require the combination of quantum processing nodes with efficient light-matter interfaces to distribute quantum information in local or long-distance quantum networks. Neutral-atom arrays have both been coupled to Rydberg states to enable high-fidelity quantum gates in universal processing architectures, and to optical cavities to realize interfaces to photons. However, combining these two capabilities and coupling atom arrays to highly excited Rydberg states in the mode of an optical cavity has been an outstanding challenge. Here we present a novel cavity-coupled Rydberg array that achieves this long-standing goal. We prepare, detect, and control individual atoms in a scalable optical tweezer array, couple them strongly to the optical mode of a high-finesse optical cavity and excite them in a controlled way to Rydberg states. We show that strong coupling to an optical cavity - demonstrated via the dispersive shift of the resonance of the cavity in presence of the atoms - and strong Rydberg interactions - demonstrated via the collective enhancement of Rydberg coupling in the atomic array - can be achieved in our setup at the same spatial location. Our presented experimental platform opens the path to several new directions, including the realization of quantum network nodes, quantum simulation of long-range interacting, open quantum systems and photonic-state engineering leveraging high-fidelity Rydberg control.",

In reality, however, when a specific interaction Hamiltonian is given, different baryons should have unequal oscillator frequencies due to distinct interaction potentials induced by their different quantum numbers. In this work, we develop a new quark-level RGM formalism for baryon-baryon systems with unequal oscillator frequencies, with the aim of describing both single baryons and baryon-baryon interactions in a consistent framework. We present the formalism for solving bound-state and scattering problems, with particular emphasis on constructing the wave functions of two-baryon systems with unequal oscillator frequencies. The proposed formalism is then applied to the $NΔ$ system within a chiral SU(3) quark model, where the quark-quark interaction includes, in addition to the one-gluon exchange (OGE) and a phenomenological confinement potential, the nonet scalar and pseudoscalar meson exchanges arising from the spontaneous breaking of chiral SU(3) symmetry. The distinctive features of the newly developed formalism are elucidated by comparing the results from the new formulation with those from traditional calculations.",

The prevailing view, developed over decades, holds that this relaxation is rapidly filtered into a linear regime, establishing linear perturbation theory as the bedrock of black hole spectroscopy and a key pillar of gravitational-wave physics. Here we unveil a distinct nonlinear regime that transcends the traditional paradigm: before the familiar linear ringdown, an intrinsically nonlinear, long-lived bottleneck can dominate the evolution. This stage is controlled by a saddle-node ghost in phase space, which traps the remnant and delays the onset of linearity by a timescale obeying a universal power-law. The ghost imprints a distinctive quiescence-burst signature on the emitted radiation: a prolonged silence followed by a violent burst and a delayed ringdown. Rooted in the bifurcation topology, it extends naturally to neutron and boson stars, echoing a topological universality shared with diverse nonlinear systems in nature. Our results expose a missing nonlinear chapter in gravitational dynamics and identify ghost-induced quiescence-burst patterns as clear targets for future observations.",

We identify strict gaps between them, uncover previously assumed but missing implications, and construct explicit counterexamples to characterize the boundaries between distinct classes. In particular, we show that commutativity of the parameter-encoding generators alone does not ensure the saturability of the QCR bound once realistic noise produces mixed probe states.

While previous NV-based vector magnetometry methods require partial knowledge of the magnetic field (e.g. a calibrated bias field), we exploit the possibilities of selecting particular directions of the spins in the diamond with elliptically polarized microwave fields.

We develop a unified framework to study PBH formation in dust-radiation bouncing cosmologies, focusing on the classical contracting phase so that the results are insensitive to bounce details. We compute the curvature power spectrum for an extremely small dust equation of state using a stable semi-analytical (adiabatic) method, derive the Jeans length of the two-fluid system using dynamical-system analysis and the WKB approximation, and extend the three-zone model from the single- to the two-fluid case to model local collapse. We implement two collapse criteria to obtain the curvature perturbation threshold for PBH formation and estimate PBH mass fractions for benchmark masses spanning low-mass ($10^{-17} M_{\\odot}$) to supermassive ($10^{13} M_{\\odot}$) scales. The critical curvature threshold is extremely small and nearly mass-independent over a broad range $(ζ_c \\sim 10^{-21}$ for $10^{-14}$ to $10^{13} M_{\\odot})$, with deviations only near dust-radiation equality. Nevertheless, the square root of the curvature power spectrum at the relevant formation times is many orders of magnitude smaller, yielding vanishingly small PBH mass fractions across the benchmark masses. Compared with the pure-dust case, radiation pressure and the two-fluid collapse conditions significantly suppress PBH production, implying that substantial PBH formation in dust-radiation bouncing cosmologies would require additional mechanisms to amplify curvature perturbations.",

Assuming that all fusion channels of symmetry operators have the same index, we show that the fusion rules of finitely many symmetry operators on a tensor product Hilbert space can agree, up to QCAs, only with those of weakly integral fusion categories. We also discuss an attempt to establish an index theory for non-invertible symmetries within the framework of tensor networks. To this end, we first propose a general class of matrix product operators (MPOs) that describe non-invertible symmetries on a tensor product Hilbert space. These MPOs, which we refer to as topological injective MPOs, include all invertible symmetries, non-anomalous fusion category symmetries, and the Kramers-Wannier symmetries for finite abelian groups. For topological injective MPOs, we construct the defect Hilbert spaces and the corresponding sequential quantum circuit representations. We also show that all fusion channels of topological injective MPOs have the same index if there exist fusion and splitting tensors that satisfy appropriate conditions. The existence of such fusion and splitting tensors has not been proven in general, although we construct them explicitly for all examples of topological injective MPOs listed above.",

Matrix Product States (MPS) admit more efficient constructions, particularly when accuracy is traded for circuit complexity. Existing approaches to MPS preparation mostly rely on heuristic circuits that are deterministic but quickly saturate in accuracy, or on variational optimization methods that reach high fidelities but scale poorly. This work introduces an end-to-end MPS preparation framework that combines the strengths of both strategies within a single pipeline. Heuristic staircase-like and brick wall disentangler circuits provide warm-start initializations for variational optimization, enabling high-fidelity state preparation for large systems. Target MPSs are either specified as physical quantum states or constructed from classical datasets via amplitude encoding, using step-by-step singular value decompositions or tensor cross interpolation. The framework incorporates entanglement-based qubit reordering, reformulated as a quadratic assignment problem, and low-level optimizations that reduce depths by up to 50% and CNOT counts by 33%. We evaluate the full pipeline on datasets of varying complexity across systems of 19-50 qubits and identify trade-offs between fidelity, gate count, and circuit depth. Optimized brick wall circuits typically achieve the lowest depths, while the optimized staircase-like circuits minimize gate counts. Overall, our results provide principled and scalable protocols for preparing MPSs as quantum circuits, supporting utility-scale applications on near-term quantum devices.",

      "abstract": "We investigate different treatments of dark matter (DM) distributions surrounding extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) to assess their impact on orbital evolution and gravitational wave emission. Density profiles derived from the mass current and from the energy-momentum tensor using a distribution function yield consistent results, but both differ substantially from profiles obtained using an anisotropic fluid model based on Einstein cluster ansatz. We find that the inclusion of radial pressure significantly modifies both the orbital dynamics and the resulting gravitational wave waveforms. By analyzing waveform dephasing and mismatches, we show that a fully relativistic treatment of DM distributions can substantially alter the detectability thresholds of DM halos. Our results demonstrate that radial pressure and relativistic modeling of DM are essential for accurately describing the dynamics and observational signatures of EMRIs embedded in DM halos.",

The development of data analysis software infrastructure at the current stage is crucial. In this paper, we introduce \\texttt{pespace} which can be used for the full Bayesian parameter estimation of massive black hole binaries with detectors including LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin. The core computations are implemented using the high-performance parallel programming framework \\texttt{taichi-lang} which enables automatic differentiation and hardware acceleration across different architectures. We also reimplement the waveform models \\texttt{PhenomXAS} and \\texttt{PhenomXHM} in the separate package \\texttt{tiwave} to integrate waveform generation within the \\texttt{taichi-lang} scope, making the entire computation accelerated and differentiable. To demonstrate the functionality of the tool, we use a typical signal from a massive black hole binary to perform the full Bayesian parameter estimation with the complete likelihood function for three scenarios: including a single detector using the waveform with only the dominant mode; a single detector using the waveform including higher modes; and a detector network with higher modes included. The results demonstrate that higher modes are essential in breaking degeneracies, and coincident observations by the detector network can significantly improve the measurement of source properties. Additionally, automatic differentiation provides an accurate way to obtain the Fisher matrix without manual fine-tuning of the finite difference step size. Using a subset of extrinsic parameters, we show that the approximated posteriors obtained by the Fisher matrix agree well with those derived from Bayesian parameter estimation.",

A major challenge is that while the pseudoscalar-meson couplings are well-determined, the couplings for scalar- and vector-meson exchanges render significant model dependence. To ensure the reliability of our predictions and reduce model dependence, we recalibrate the coupling constants of the OBE model. We treat the pole position of $Z_c(3900)$, or equivalently the scalar $σ$-exchange coupling constant, as the only unknown parameter. The coupling constants for the vector $ρ$- and $ω$-exchanges are determined by the pole positions of the well established states $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)$. We demonstrate that these parameter sets also successfully describe the $T_{cs0}(2870)$ without further tuning. For the three-body system, our results indicate that an $I\\left(J^P\\right)=1 / 2\\left(0^{-}\\right)$ three-body molecular bound state exists when $Z_c(3900)$ is a virtual state located within approximately $-10~\\text{MeV}$ of the $D\\bar{D}^*$ threshold. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the complex energy plane using the complex scaling method to search for molecular resonances, though no evidence of resonances is found in considered channels. We also apply this formalism to the bottom analog $BB^*K^*$ system. In this sector, the conditions for the existence of a three-body bound state are more relaxed, as a $Z_c(3900)$ virtual state located within $-25~\\text{MeV}$ below the threshold suffices, although three-body molecular resonances remain absent. We suggest that future experiments precisely measure the pole position of $Z_c(3900)$ or search for the three-body bound state in $DD\\bar{K}ππ$ and $DD\\bar{K}$ channels, as these efforts would mutually illuminate the nature of the associated states.",

An excellent description of experimentally measured abundances of H and He isotopes is obtained. We examine two possible modelling of in-medium effects as an increased in-medium effective mass, or an increased vector repulsion. We show that these physical pictures cannot be discriminated by the data. In both cases, the temperature dependence of the meson couplings leads to a faster weakening of the light cluster abundances with temperature than previous studies predicted. Possible systematic errors due to out-of-equilibrium effects affecting the experimental abundances, are considered by repeating the Bayesian inference with reduced information. The abundance prediction of the species excluded from the constraint is well compatible with the experimental data, suggesting that there is no a priori need of accounting for non-equilibrium effects or finite state interactions that potentially affect the deuteron yield.",

However, despite promising proof-of-principle results, such methods suffer from high sensitivity to noise (including intrinsic sources such as sampling noise), making their utility for realistic industry-relevant problems an open question. To improve the potential applicability of such methods, we introduce a new variant of thresholding for noisy generalized eigenvalue problems that arise in quantum subspace diagonalization that has the potential to better control sensitivity to noise. Our approach leverages eigenvector-preserving transformations (rotations) of the generalized eigenvalue problem prior to thresholding. We study this effect in practical settings by applying this rotation thresholding scheme to an iterative quantum Krylov algorithm for several chemical systems, including the industry-relevant Fe(III)-NTA chelate complex. We develop a particular heuristic to select the rotation angle from noisy data and find for certain systems and noise regimes that the samples required to reach a target error for ground state estimation can be reduced by a factor of up to 100. Furthermore, with oracle access to the optimal transformation, more dramatic improvements are possible and we observe reductions in sample requirements by up to $10^4$, motivating the continued development of methods that can realize these improvements in practice. While we develop our approach in the context of quantum subspace diagonalization, the improved thresholding scheme we develop could be advantageous in any context where one must solve noisy, ill-conditioned generalized eigenvalue problems.",

These methods enable low-latency primitives for readout calibration, spectroscopy, pulse-amplitude calibration, coherence estimation, and benchmarking. We deploy this toolset to estimate $T_1$ in 10 ms, optimize readout parameters in 100 ms, optimize pulse amplitudes in 1 ms, and perform Clifford randomized gate benchmarking in 107 ms on a flux-tunable superconducting transmon qubit. Running a closed-loop on-FPGA recalibration protocol continuously for 6 hours enables more than 74,000 consecutive recalibrations and yields gate errors that consistently retain better performance than the baseline initial calibration. Correlation analysis shows that recalibration suppresses coupling of gate error to control-parameter drift while preserving a coherence-linked performance.

Consequently, future prospects could probe new physics whose contribution to the electron EDM first arises at three-loop order. Additional SU(2)$_L$ multiplets with CP-violating Yukawa interactions, which contribute to the electron EDM at three-loop level, is one such testable new physics scenario. In this scenario, the electron EDM is radiatively induced from two contributions: the CP-odd trilinear $W$-boson coupling, called the electroweak-Weinberg operator, and the CP-odd dipole operator of electron. The former and the latter operators are generated at two-loop and three-loop levels, respectively, after integrating out the SU(2)$_L$ multiplets. Within the same models, according to an analysis based on the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we previously found that the contribution to the electron EDM from the electroweak-Weinberg operator can be probed in future experiments. However, the one-loop matching condition between the electron EDM and the electroweak-Weinberg operator does not receive a large logarithmic enhancement because the associated anomalous dimension is zero. The CP-odd dipole operator of the electron would contribute to the electron EDM at the same three-loop order as the contribution through the electroweak-Weinberg operator. In this paper, we directly calculate the electron EDM induced by the CP-violating Yukawa interactions of the SU(2)$_L$ multiplets at full three-loop level. A central result is that the full three-loop calculation is a factor of three larger than that of the electroweak-Weinberg operator alone.",

However, standard quantum teleportation is fundamentally limited by the quadratic growth of measurement complexity and high classical communication overhead, requiring the resolution of $d^2$ Bell states and $2\\log_2 d$ classical bits. In this study, we propose a resource-efficient high-dimensional coherence teleportation (REHDCT) protocol. By designing $d$ sets of specialized positive operator-valued measure (POVM) bases, our protocol achieves a 50\\% reduction in classical communication by utilizing one of the $d$ designed POVM sets, which effectively scales the measurement complexity from $O(d^2)$ to $O(d)$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by utilizing initial phase engineering to align the target qudit with the measurement basis, theoretically perfect teleportation of quantum coherence can be achieved for arbitrary qudit states. A quantitative robustness analysis reveals that the protocol remains highly resilient to operational errors, maintaining an efficiency above 99.6\\% even under a 0.1 rad phase deviation for $d=16$. Our analysis under various noise models (amplitude damping, phase flip, depolarizing, and dit-flip) confirms that high-dimensional systems exhibit an expanding quantum advantage window as dimensionality increases. Notably, under dit-flip noise, perfect coherence teleportation can be restored through the optimal selection of the POVM basis.

We consider an architecture with separate measurement and detection modules, and assume that the observables relevant to the detector are unknown to the measurement device. For this scenario, we introduce shadow-based sequential changepoint e-detection (eSCD), a novel protocol that combines a universal measurement strategy based on classical shadows with a nonparametric sequential test built on e-detectors. Classical shadows provide universality with respect to the detector's choice of observables, while the e-detector framework enables explicit control of the average run length (ARL) to false alarm. Under an ARL constraint, we establish finite-sample guarantees on the worst-case expected detection delay of eSCD. Numerical experiments validate the theory and demonstrate that eSCD achieves performance competitive with observable-specific measurement strategies, while retaining full measurement universality.",

For an even number of particles, the spectra conform to the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble, as expected for a time-reversal-symmetric Hamiltonian. In stark contrast, the odd-parity sector exhibits exact double degeneracy of all eigenstates even after resolving all known symmetries, and the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble accurately describes the spacing distribution between these doublets.

Modelling and analysis of the performance of satellite entanglement pair distribution is important for the architecture and design of constellations and space systems. Entanglement-based quantum key distribution, in the absence of quantum repeaters, is especially prone to finite key effects due to low coincident count rates compared to trusted node single-path links. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive study of finite-key effects in the context of direct dual downlink quantum key distribution taking into account the characteristics of the overpass geometries. We develop a high-fidelity model of pair distribution from a low Earth orbit satellite that captures orbital dynamics, elevation-dependent loss, background noise, and extraneous detector effects. We integrate this with a rigorous finite-key security framework for the BBM92 protocol to optimise secret key length across different overpass geometries, orbital altitudes, and optical ground station (OGS) separations.

Holonomy corrections to the evaporation rate enter through the greybody factor, slowing down the evaporation process when the holonomy modification function decreases monotonically. Accounting for backreaction, corrected covariant semi-classical stress-energy tensors are computed in various vacuum states.

Here we develop two new methods to numerically obtain the $\\textit{exact parameters}$ by means of usual Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff computation, and find that the difference with the value of standard post-Newtonian parameters can be more than 80% in some situations. We also provide the connection with the Damour-Esposito Farèse non-pertubative parameter $α_{DEF}$. We then apply the methodology to the case of Entangled Relativity, and derive these exact parameters for the Sun and the Earth, as well as for neutron stars. We argue that current and foreseeable experiments are likely able to constrain the theory under the assumption that $\\mathcal{L}_m=-ρ$, where $ρ$ is the total energy density. If $\\mathcal{L}_m=T$ instead, as often advocated in the literature, then there is no deviation with respect to General Relativity and the prospects of testing Entangled Relativity become much more remote in time, as only compact objects with extreme electric or magnetic fields could lead to some deviation from General Relativity.",

An inherent outcome of holography that plays a crucial role in our analysis is the \\textit{RG flow of boundary conditions}: the rigid Dirichlet conditions on the background metric in the UV become an admixture of Dirichlet and Neumann as we flow to the IR, thereby ``unfreezing'' the metric and transforming it from a non-dynamical background into a dynamical field. This mechanism, which is a conceptually new addition to the standard Wilsonian RG flow, also provides the mechanism to evade the Weinberg-Witten no-go theorem. Within the GR from RG picture outlined here, the search for a quantum theory of gravity by treating the metric as a fundamental field may be a hunt for a phantom -- akin to seeking the atomic structure of water by quantizing the equations of hydrodynamics.",

In this context, we analyze the design and performance of distributed Quantum Extreme Learning Machine (QELM) architectures for learning functions of quantum states directly from data, restricting measurements to easily implementable projective measurements in the computational basis. The aim is to determine which schemes can effectively recover specific properties of input quantum states, including both linear and nonlinear features, while also quantifying the resource requirements in terms of measurements and reservoir dimensionality. We compare standard three-layer QELM with a spatially multiplexed architecture composed of multiple independent three-layer units for linear (quantum) tasks, showing a linear reduction in resource requirements per unit. For nonlinear properties, the study examines the multiple-injection architecture and introduces a novel distributed design that incorporates entanglement between subsystems within a spatially multiplexed framework, evaluating its performance through the reconstruction of complex nonlinear quantities such as polynomial targets, Rényi entropy, and entanglement measures. Our results demonstrate that the distributed design enables the reconstruction of higher-order nonlinearities by increasing the number of interacting subsystems with reduced resources, rather than increasing the size of an individual reservoir, providing a scalable and hardware-efficient route to quantum property learning.",

We find that dimensionless observables such as the entropy density $s/T^3$, the pressure $P/T^4$, the energy density $\\varepsilon/T^4$, the trace anomaly $Δ= (\\varepsilon - 3P)/T^4$, and the specific heat at constant volume $C_V/T^3$ are sensitive to both finite magnetic field and chemical potential. As the chemical potential increases from zero, these quantities rise in both the hadronic and quark-gluon plasma phases. In contrast, introducing a magnetic field suppresses them at low temperatures but enhances them at high temperatures. Furthermore, nonzero chemical potential and magnetic field introduce nontrivial modifications to the squared speed of sound $c_s^2$. Both effects increase $c_s^2$ close to the critical temperature while reducing it at lower temperatures. When the chemical potential and magnetic field are present simultaneously, their influences superimpose, leading to more intricate changes in the thermodynamic behavior. Finally, we compare our results with the lattice QCD data for the quadratic fluctuations of conserved charges and their correlations. The model successfully reproduces the temperature dependence of these observables at $eB=0$ and 0.04 GeV$^2$. However, at the stronger field strength $eB=0.14$ GeV$^2$, the model underestimates the magnitudes while still capturing the overall temperature trend.",

As a result, quantum coherence is being harnessed to boost performance in quantum heat engines, photocells, and photosynthetic-inspired platforms. Of particular interest in this context is the generation of Fano coherences, i.e., the formation of quantum coherences due to the interaction with the continuum of modes characterizing an incoherent process. We aim to formalize mathematically the possibility of achieving steady-state Fano coherence in a V-type three-level quantum system using polarized incoherent radiation, without requiring the energy difference between the excited levels to tend to zero. We perform this analysis by deriving the Bloch-Redfield equation from first-principles by quantizing the incoherent radiation. The resulting reduced dynamics of the system are analysed, so as to determine the lifetime of Fano coherence and identify the conditions under which it becomes stationary. We characterise distinct dynamical regimes, ranging from weak to strong pumping, in which steady-state Fano coherence emerges, and we quantitatively determine its magnitude. For each regime, we analyse the generation of Fano coherence as a function of both the intensity of the incoherent pumping and the energy splitting between the excited levels. We also assess how obtaining Fano coherence is modified by symmetric or asymmetric decay rates. These findings indicate that a three-level quantum system driven by polarized incoherent light can act as a robust resource for coherence-assisted energy conversion and storage. Finally, we discuss the experimental challenges associated with the implementation of the proposed model using an ensemble of Rubidium atoms.",

By construction, the stochastic formalism relies on the separation of scales, which requires solving the equations for UV modes on top of the evolving IR modes for all modes at every time step, leading to a non-Markovian system in general. In this paper, working on a de Sitter background, we analyze several representative models by simultaneously solving the Langevin equations for IR modes and the equations for UV modes at each time step. We demonstrate that once the effects of effective masses are treated consistently by our simulation, the flat direction in the minimal supersymmtric model (MSSM) does not saturate but instead evolves as an exactly flat direction. Furthermore, we investigate memory effects in simple two models; $V=λφ^4$ and $V=μφχ+ λφ^4$, and non-Markovian contributions can lead to quantitative differences, even in stationary configurations, when compared with Markovian approximations, particularly in the strong-coupling regime.",

This correspondence identifies the linear growth rate of Lanczos coefficients with the Hawking temperature, $α=πT$, thereby recovering the saturation of the maximal chaos bound. Notably, the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound, a fundamental stability criterion in AdS gravity, emerges as a necessary consistency requirement for the dual description of Krylov subspace dynamics. Our results advance a Krylov-based holographic dictionary in a unified $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ representation, revealing that the emergent geometry of Krylov subspace is a reflection of the near-horizon AdS spacetime.",

      "abstract": "A central task in quantum information science is state certification: testing whether an unknown state is $ε_1$-close to a fixed target state, or $ε_2$-far. Recent work has shown that surprisingly simple measurement protocols--comprising only single-qubit measurements--suffice to certify arbitrary $n$-qubit states [Huang, Preskill, Soleimanifar '25; Gupta, He, O'Donnell '25]. However, these certification protocols are not robust: rather than allowing constant $ε_1$, they can only positively certify states within $ε_1=O(1/n)$ trace distance of the target. In many experimental settings, the appropriate error tolerance is constant as the system size grows, so this lack of robustness renders existing tests inapplicable at scale, no matter how many times the test is repeated.\n  Here we present robust certification protocols based on few-qubit measurements that apply to all but a $O(2^{-n})$-fraction of pure target states. Our first protocol achieves constant robustness, i.e. $ε_1=Θ(1)$, using a single $O(\\log n)$-qubit measurement along with single-qubit measurements in the $Z$ or $X$ basis on the other qubits. As a corollary of its robustness, this protocol also achieves constant (in $n$) copy complexity, which is optimal. Our second protocol uses exclusively single-qubit measurements and is nearly robust: $ε_1=Ω(1/\\log n)$. Our tests are based on a new uncertainty principle for conditional fidelities, which may be of independent interest.",

The correlation between the formation of electron-hole puddles in nearer to the charge neutrality point (CNP), and the role of disorder is fundamentally important for Dirac transport in graphene systems. Numerous studies on graphene further urge the necessity to find a better descriptor for disorder-charge puddles relation, which directly influences electrical conductivity. In principle, the external bias-driven energy level shift and its relevant density of states (DOS) provide information about the effect of total interactive potential on linear energy dispersion in terms of wavevector, but yet to be well-explored. With this ground, here we map the energy quantization for Dirac materials through the empirical relation of voltage-driven charge density in monolayer graphene, using the differential entropy (h)-ruled wavevector (k) mechanics. For this work, we propose the four postulates which are the key observable descriptions of earlier research reports, to study the precise electronic transport via an entropy-guided wavevector propagation approach, along with the Klein paradox, which pertains to the ultrafast dynamics in the Dirac or quasi-Dirac systems. The introduced h-ruled k and h-ruled N relations generalize the electron dynamics in both the unbounded and potentially bounded Dirac systems. Through the quantization mapping procedure under different voltage-driven potential (U=eV) boundary conditions, the observed energy shift from lower to excited quantum state obeys the relation of N(k)=N(U)^3; here, N(U) is the voltage-driven potential energy contribution factor for the quantum state existence. This study reveals information about the interaction potential-DOS relationship in the Dirac materials.",

To address this, we propose a multiparty circular QBA protocol that adopts a semi-decentralized architecture, leveraging circular message gathering and quantum digital signatures to achieve quadratic communication complexity and enhanced fault tolerance. Our protocol is experimentally feasible, requiring only weak coherent states, and is compatible with existing star-shaped quantum networks. Simulations conducted on a global satellite-to-ground network demonstrate that the protocol sustains high consensus rates among multiple users, even when employing different key generation protocols under realistic conditions.

Remarkably, we uncover a counterintuitive phenomenon: as the Hawking temperature increases, quantum entanglement ($1$-$3$ tangle) of the $CL_4$ state remains strictly constant, indicating a ``complete freezing of initially maximal entanglement\". This constitutes the first explicit example in which maximal entanglement remains perfectly preserved in a black hole environment, defying the conventional expectation that gravitational effects can only suppress maximal quantum correlations.

This note explores these assumptions by computing correction terms in powers of $m/E$ up to order $(m/E)^4$. The assumptions are found to be robust: not only is the leading correction quadratic in $m/E$, but also cancellations reduce its coefficient and that of the next-to-leading correction, which is of order $(m/E)^4$.

The results show good agreement with available experimental data. For the total cross section of $Λ(1405)$ production, the $u$-channel contribution is dominant, whereas the $t$-channel contribution plays the primary role in $Λ(1520)$ production. Furthermore, the differential cross sections of the two processes exhibit distinctly different shapes, reflecting their distinct underlying reaction mechanisms. An analysis based on the constituent counting rule indicates that $Λ(1520)$ is consistent with a conventional three-quark configuration, while $Λ(1405)$ shows a clear deviation, suggesting a more exotic structure. Owing to the large branching ratio of $Λ^* \\to πΣ$, the Dalitz process $π^{-} p \\rightarrow K Λ^{*} \\rightarrow K πΣ$ is also calculated.

When $G$ is connected and simply connected, we show that gauging a CP symmetry does not produce any new anomaly beyond the one before gauging it. In particular, the standard model matter content does not have anomalies.",

We assembled a massive dataset of TLS across 6,000 Al/AlOx/Al JJs and more than 600 atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy images. We statistically link fabrication, microstructure, and TLS occurrence, revealing a strong correlation between Al electrode thickness, Al grain size, and TLS density. Correspondingly, we find a two-thirds reduction in TLS prompted by a change in electrode fabrication parameters. These results demonstrate a robust, data-driven methodology to understand and control defects in quantum circuits and pave the way for significantly reducing TLS density.",

In particular, it is often unclear how collective enhancement, spontaneous emission, and vacuum fluctuations jointly give rise to both paired biphoton generation and unavoidable unpaired background within a single, self-consistent framework. Here we present a fully quantum microscopic theory within a unified Heisenberg--Langevin--Maxwell framework that explicitly incorporates dissipation and quantum noise, thereby revealing the microscopic origin of superradiant biphoton emission in atomic ensembles. The theory provides a consistent description of parametric gain and unpaired noise within the same open-quantum-system framework and applies to both Doppler-free cold atomic ensembles and Doppler-broadened warm vapors. In the high-optical-depth regime, the coupled propagation equations admit analytical solutions, under which the biphoton dynamics rigorously reduce to an effective collective two-level emission process. Within this limit, the biphoton correlation time and spectral properties are shown to obey closed-form scaling relations governed by optical depth and excited-state decoherence. Our results establish a unified microscopic picture of superradiant biphoton generation and clarify the fundamental role of vacuum fluctuations and dissipation in setting the brightness, pairing efficiency, and temporal structure of atomic biphoton sources, with direct relevance to quantum networking and atomic quantum interfaces.",

Quantum synchronization provides one such example of ergodicity breaking, but previous studies have focused on open systems. Here, motivated by the problem of ergodicity breaking in closed systems and the study of non-trivial dynamics, we investigate synchronization in a closed disordered Heisenberg spin chain. In the presence of large random disorder, strongly breaking the permutation symmetry of the system, we observe the emergence of spatial synchronization, where spins lock into locally synchronized patches. This behavior can be interpreted as a fragmentation of the global dynamical symmetry $S^+$ into a collection of local dynamical symmetries, each characterized by a distinct frequency. In the weak-disorder regime, still without permutation symmetry, we show that the synchronization mechanism can be understood perturbatively within Krylov space. In the absence of disorder, the Krylov space associated with the dynamical symmetry $S^+$ is two-dimensional. Introducing disorder couples this subspace to the remainder of the Krylov space. This coupling leads only to a second-order correction to the frequency of the dynamical symmetry, thereby preserving coherent oscillations despite the presence of small disorder. At stronger disorder, the perturbation modifies $S^+$ so that it acquires a finite lifetime, providing an example of a transient dynamical symmetry.",

Different adaptations (flavors) of VQE have been implemented to combat these scalability issues on NISQ devices compared to standard VQE. These different flavors are modifications of the underlying VQE ansatz to reduce the computational workload on the quantum hardware. In this review we focus on 3 main areas related to VQE. The first focus is on flavors of VQE that fall under the categories of circuit complexity reduction, chemistry inspired ansatz, and extensions of VQE to excited states.

WSBD intelligently focuses computational resources by identifying and temporarily freezing less influential parameters based on a gradient-derived importance score. This approach significantly reduces the number of forward passes required per training step and helps navigate the optimization landscape more effectively. Unlike pruning or layer-wise freezing, WSBD maintains full expressive capacity while adapting throughout training. Our extensive evaluation shows that WSBD converges on average 63.9% faster than Adam for the popular ground-state-energy problem, an advantage that grows with QNN size. We provide a formal convergence proof for WSBD and show that parameter-wise freezing outperforms traditional layer-wise approaches in QNNs.

In conventional trapped-ion schemes, realizing a well-defined, coherent gate typically requires spectrally addressing a specific bus mode. As the ion number increases, the coupling to each individual motional mode becomes weaker, so gates on large ion strings mediated by a single mode are necessarily slow. Moreover, addressing a large number of modes demands complex driving schemes, and the fundamentally perturbative character of these approaches imposes constraints on achievable gate speed and fidelity.\n  Here, we introduce a scheme for entangling trapped-ion qubits using a time-dependent magnetic-field gradient, in which all axial motional modes participate in mediating the interaction and the gate construction is nonperturbative. The framework can be used to implement both multi-qubit gates and two-qubit gates between arbitrary pairs in a linear ion string.

While exact seniority conservation holds in single-$j$ systems with $j \\leq 7/2$, deviations arise for higher-$j$ orbitals where residual interactions can mix states of different seniority. Surprisingly, certain states in systems with $j \\geq 9/2$ exhibit partial conservation of seniority, remaining solvable even when the symmetry is expected to break. This paper reviews the theoretical foundation of the seniority scheme, its connection to pairing interactions and coefficients of fractional parentage, and the conditions under which solvability persists. Particular emphasis is placed on the $j=9/2$ case, where two $v=4$ states with $I=4$ and $I=6$ remain unmixed under arbitrary interactions. We discuss analytical proofs of their existence, numerical studies, and supporting experimental evidence from semi-magic nuclei across five regions of the nuclear chart.

By investigating $α$ separation energies and binding-energy differences along chains of fixed isospin projection and subtracting macroscopic contributions, we reveal a remarkably smooth and nearly universal behavior in the residual $α$ correlation energy. These results exhibit the parabolic trends characteristic of collective rotations in gauge space. We demonstrate that the standard definition of the gauge-space moment of inertia for like-nucleon pairing is dominated by macroscopic contributions from Coulomb and symmetry energies. Once these are removed, the remaining moment of inertia becomes negative. This suggests that the observed behavior reflects the loss of correlation energy due to Pauli-blocking effect.

The Lagrangian contains functional forms of the bulk while the boundary terms do not contribute to the dynamics. The advantage of the proposition is that the stellar structure equations are up to order two thus the theory is not haunted by ghosts. We obtain explicitly the defining equations for the thermodynamical variables and the geometry for the pure quadratic case since the linear case amounts to general relativity. In trying to establish the vacuum geometry associated with the theory it turns out that two possible metrics emerge through the vanishing of the energy-momentum tensor. Next we analyse the isotropy equation and make the observation that it is autonomous. It is rare that this happens in astrophysical modelling. This behaviour prompted the use of dynamical systems to understand the stability properties of fixed points or fixed manifolds. It was necessary to choose a gauge in order to split the autonomous equation into a system from which we could plot a phase portrait and deduce the stability of solution trajectories.

      "abstract": "It is known that two local unitaries (LU) equivalent states possess the same amount of entanglement and can be used to perform the same tasks in quantum information theory (QIT). For a protocol for a task in QIT, we call a protocol LU invariant if two LU-equivalent states are either both suitable for the protocol or neither is. So far, no one has discussed whether a protocol for a task in QIT is LU invariant. In [Phys. Rev. A, 74, 062320 (2006)], Agrawal and Pati proposed the perfect teleportation protocol (PTP) and the protocol for superdense coding to transmit 2-bit classical information by sending one qubit (PSDC-2) and 3-bit classical information by sending two qubits (PSDC-3). In this paper, we show that PTP and PSDC-2 are LU invariant. That is, two LU equivalent states are suitable for PTP and PSDC-2 or neither of them is. We show that PSDC-3 is not LU invariant. We also indicate that the teleportation proposed in <cite>Nielsen</cite> is not LU invariant. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a state to be suitable for PTP, PSDC-2, and PSDC-3, respectively. Via the LU invariance of PTP and PSDC-2, we prove that a state is suitable for PTP and PSDC-2 if and only if it has 1 ebit of shared entanglement, respectively and find all genuine entangled states and separable states which are suitable for PTP and PSDC-2, respectively. So far, no one has indicated that PTP and PSDC-2 do not require genuine entanglement. Agrawal and Pati suggested to study if there are subclasses of W SLOCC class which are suitable for PSDC-3. So far, it still remains an unsolved question. We show that any state of the SLOCC class W is not suitable for PSDC-3.",

      "abstract": "Recently, a novel approach has been proposed to compute parton distributions through the use of boosted correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge from lattice QCD, within the framework of Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET). This approach circumvents the need for Wilson lines, potentially enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of lattice calculations. In this work, we present the first exploratory implementation of the Coulomb gauge method for calculating nucleon unpolarized, helicity, and transversity parton distribution functions (PDFs). The calculations are performed on a Highly-Improved-Staggered-Quark ensemble with lattice spacing $a = 0.06$ fm, volume $L_s^3 \\times L_t=48^3\\times 64$, and valence pion mass $m_π=300$ MeV, employing boosted nucleon states with momenta up to 3.04 GeV. Our lattice predictions for the valence-quark PDFs -- extracted from the real part of the correlators -- show good convergence with increasing nucleon momentum and are compatible with the most recent global analyses for all spin structures. On the other hand, the full-quark-channel PDFs obtained from the imaginary part of the correlators exhibit discrepancies between the two large nucleon momenta considered, although the results at the higher momentum are consistent with phenomenology. The discrepancies are likely driven by stronger excited-state contamination in the imaginary matrix elements, which is consistent with the observation in the literature. Overall, this work demonstrates the efficacy of the Coulomb gauge approach for nucleon PDFs and serves as a benchmark for its broader applications.",

      "abstract": "Pair-instability supernovae leave behind no compact remnants, resulting in a predicted gap in the distribution of stellar black-hole masses. Gravitational waves from binary black-hole mergers probe the relevant mass range and analyses of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog (GWTC-4) indicate a possible mass cutoff at $40$-$50M_\\odot$. However, the robustness of this result is yet to be tested. To this end, we simulate a comprehensive suite of gravitational-wave catalogs with full Bayesian parameter estimation and analyze them with parametric population models. For catalogs similar to GWTC-4, confident identification of a cutoff is not guaranteed, but GWTC-4 results are compatible with the best constraints among our simulations. Conversely, spurious false identification of a cutoff is unlikely. For catalogs expected by the end of the O4 observing run, uncertainty in the cutoff mass is reduced by $\\gtrsim20\\%$, but a cutoff at $40$-$50M_\\odot$ yields only a lower bound on the $^{12}\\mathrm{C}(α,γ)^{16}\\mathrm{O}$ reaction rate, which in terms of the S-factor at $300\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ may be $S_{300}\\gtrsim125\\,\\mathrm{keV}\\,\\mathrm{b}$ at $90\\%$ credibility by the end of O4. Relative uncertainties on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ from gravitational-wave data alone can still be up to $100\\%$. We also analyze GWTC-4 with the nonparametric PixelPop population model, finding that some mass features are more prominent than in parametric models but a sharp cutoff is not required. However, the parametric model passes a likelihood-based predictive test in GWTC-4 and the PixelPop results are consistent with those from our simulated catalogs where a cutoff is present. We use the simple focus of this study to emphasize that such tests are necessary to make astrophysical claims from gravitational-wave catalogs going forward.",

      "abstract": "Estimating redshift is a central task in astrophysics, but its measurement is costly and time-consuming. In addition, current image-based methods are often validated on homogeneous datasets. The development and comparison of networks able generalize across different morphologies, ranging from galaxies to gravitationally-lensed transients, and observational conditions, remain an open challenge. This work proposes DeepRed, a deep learning pipeline that demonstrates how modern computer vision architectures, including ResNet, EfficientNet, Swin Transformer, and MLP-Mixer, can estimate redshifts from images of galaxies, gravitational lenses, and gravitationally-lensed supernovae. We compare these architectures and their ensemble to both neural networks (A1, A3, NetZ, and PhotoZ) and a feature-based method (HOG+SVR) on simulated (DeepGraviLens) and real (KiDS, SDSS) datasets. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on all datasets. On DeepGraviLens, DeepRed achieves a significant improvement in the Normalized Mean Absolute Deviation compared to the best baseline (PhotoZ): 55% on DES-deep (using EfficientNet), 51% on DES-wide (Ensemble), 52% on DESI-DOT (Ensemble), and 46% on LSST-wide (Ensemble). On real observations from the KiDS survey, the pipeline outperforms the best baseline (NetZ), improving NMAD by 16% on a general test set without high-probability lenses (Ensemble) and 27% on high-probability lenses (Ensemble). For non-lensed galaxies in the SDSS dataset, the MLP-Mixer architecture achieves a 5% improvement over the best baselines (A3 and NetZ). SHAP shows that the models correctly focus on the objects of interest with over 95% localization accuracy on high-quality images, validating the reliability of the predictions. These findings suggest that deep learning is a scalable, robust, and interpretable solution for redshift estimation in large-scale surveys.",

Motivated by this, we study a model in which $μ-τ$ reflection symmetry naturally emerges from an underlying $A_4$ flavor symmetry within a type-II seesaw framework. Beyond its standard predictions of $θ_{23}=45^{\\circ}$ and $δ_{\\rm CP}=\\pm π/2$, the framework yields testable predictions for $θ_{12}$ that can be probed by JUNO. Two viable scenarios arise, one predicting $\\sin^2θ_{12} \\gsim 0.335$, which is strongly disfavored by the latest JUNO results. Correlations between $θ_{12}$ and model parameters further enhance the model's predictivity. Future measurements at DUNE and T2HK will provide complementary tests of this scenario.",
